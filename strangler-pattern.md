# Strangler Pattern

- Legacy Bank applications -> COBOL

  - Break overall functionality into small verticals
    - Like,
      - Balance System (Java) (out by April)
      - Transfer Services (Node.js) (out by July)
      - Forex Services (out by next March)
      - Loan systems

- At odds with, rewriting and redesigning the entire application
